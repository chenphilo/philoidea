Saul Kripke's `Naming and Necessity` key conclusions:

**Rejection of Descriptivist Theories**: Kripke critiques descriptivist theories, which suggest that a name's reference is determined by a set of descriptions associated with it. He argues that such theories fail because an individual might not satisfy the associated descriptions, yet the name would still refer to that individual. For example, even if Aristotle had not accomplished any of the deeds we commonly associate with him, the name "Aristotle" would still refer to him. 

**Causal Theory of Reference**: As an alternative, Kripke proposes that a name refers to an object through a causal-historical chain. This means that a name is linked to its referent by an initial `baptism` and is subsequently passed along through communicative exchanges within a linguistic community. 

**Rigid Designators (剛性指示詞)**: Kripke introduces the concept of rigid designators, which are terms that refer to the same object in every possible world where that object exists. Proper names are rigid designators because they consistently refer to the same entity across all possible scenarios. For instance, "Nixon" refers to the same person in every possible world where Nixon exists. 

**Necessary A Posteriori Truths**: Kripke argues that there are statements which are necessarily true but known only through empirical means. Examples include identity statements like "Hesperus is Phosphorus" (both referring to the planet Venus) and natural kind statements like "Water is H2O." These truths are necessary because they hold in all possible worlds, yet they are discovered a posteriori through experience. 

**Necessity of Identity**: Building on the concept of rigid designators, Kripke contends that if two names refer to the same object, then the identity between them is necessary. That is, if "a" and "b" are rigid designators of the same entity, then "a = b" is true in all possible worlds where that entity exists. 

These conclusions have significantly influenced the philosophy of language and metaphysics, reshaping discussions on reference, meaning, and necessity.

rigidity $\approx$ transworld identity $\neq$  possible world realism
- Plantinga： possible world realism (abstract set of propositions) + rigidity 
- Lewis: possible world realism (real as actual world) + not rigidity 
- Bas Van Fraassen: instrumentalist + rigidity
