# Argument pattern
## SELF REFERENCE

- Rusuall paradox
  - background: naive set theory
  - unrestricted comprehension principle: 
    - $\forall w_1, \dots, w_n \; \exists B \; \forall x \; (x \in B \iff \varphi(x, w_1, \dots, w_n))$
      - $B=\{x:\ \varphi (x, w_1, \dots, w_n)\}$
    - means, for any property $P$, there exists a set $\{x | P(x)\}$
  - the Russell set: $R = \{x | x\notin x\}$ 
    - then $R\in R \iff R\notin R$, contradiction
- Gödel's incompleteness theorems
- turing machine
- Tarski's undefinability theorem

- skolem paradox

- against universal realist: the universal「does not exemplify itself」

- against Substratum Theory: the attribute「to be bare is to possess no attribute」

- Evans's Argument Against Vague Identity


## INFINITE REGRESS

## OTHERS
- Moorean argument
  - background: sceptism argument (Modus ponens)
    - If S knows that q, then S knows that not-sk.
    - S doesn't know that not-sk.
    - Therefore, S doesn't know that q.
  - Moorean argument: (Modus tollens)
    - If S knows that q, then S knows that not-sk.
    - S knows that q.
    - Therefore, S knows that not-sk.
  - Moorean facts: those things that we know better than we know the premises of any philosophical argument to the contrary (DeRose, Keith 1999)
    - Here is one hand > 「S doesn't know that not-sk.」
