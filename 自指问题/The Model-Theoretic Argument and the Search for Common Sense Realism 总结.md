# The Model-Theoretic Argument and the Search for Common Sense Realism Hillary Putnam まとめる

abandoned "`anti-realism`" and "`verificationist semantics`", defended in：
- Realism and Reason (1977) 
- Models and Reality (1980)
- Reason, Truth, and History (1981)

not due `to theory model argument against metaphysical realism` but due to some based assumptions that were almost universal in philosophy since Descartes must be rejected.

## A Brief History of My Views

metaphysical realist: correspondence with reality. The post-Tarskian "metaphysical realist" adopts a relation called reference, occurring between every proper name. (in standard formalized language, only proper names with denotations are permissible) truth is defined in terms of correspondence. (between predicates and elements of their extension)

emphasize:
- `post-Tarskian character`
- I reject this theory only when "reference" is to be `a relation independent of the theory`, some metaphysical correspondence relation. (never denied that one can speak of correspondence between a descriptive term and the entities it refers to when the notions of "correspondence" and "reference" are given meaning according to how we use them in a specific context.)

metaphysical realist: truth and the correspondence on which truth is based are entirely `non-epistemic`, meaning that even a theory which is optimal according to all reasonable epistemic standards could actually be false.

MTA's conclusion: an epistemically ideal theory could be false is inconsistent.

Putnam's view:

- "Reason, Truth, and History" (1981): a proposition is true if and only if it would be `rationally acceptable under ideal cognitive conditions`.

- "Realism and Reason" (1977) : `first time`, I presented my model-theoretic argument and renounced metaphysical realism.  and contained an entirely different argument against metaphysical realism - `conceptual relativity` (use since "The Many Faces of Realism" (1987)): `inconsistent with each other, but both are "correct"` (in math: set theory, in which functions are identified with `ordered pairs of sets`, and set theory in which sets are identified with "`characteristic functions`", are inconsistent. in physics: ...)

MTA and conceptual relativity comparison:
- MTA against the claim that even an epistemically ideal theory could be false, and hence its ultimate result was `verificationist`.
- conceptual relativity against the claim that metaphysical realist assumes that the world (here I limit myself to empirical claims) must determine the fixedness of "individual objects" and "properties and relations" and higher types... (Russellian hierarchy), in this "infinitary" language there will be exactly `one true theory` of the world.

conceptual relativity should be recognized as a real and non-trivial phenomenon, but the assumptions on which the model-theoretic argument was based must be rejected.

Putnam agree now: Gomez suggested that my model-theoretic argument `presupposes a Cartesian view of perception`: contents are objects "inside" us, objects in the "theater of the mind"; he also said that "Sense and Sensibilia" by John Austin might contain a way to unravel this whole problem.

epistemically ideal:
 - optimal simplicity, elegance, coherence with previous doctrines, credibility, etc.
 - `operational requirements`
   - define: Usually, when theory T implies the sentence 'Hilary Putnam sees a cow', Hilary Putnam will seem to himself to see a cow. 
   - can be fulfilled even though the entities involved are "false in reality" - brains in a vat
   - inconsistency of this scenario: `How is it that our terms are understood to refer to things like cows if what we see are not cows?` it's sufficient to assume that `causal requirements` are imposed on reference.
