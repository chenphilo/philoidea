# Certainty-Loss Framework (CLF)
The goal of a CLF model is to determine what requirements an agent's changing set of certainties places on her degrees of belief in claims of which she is less-than-certain.

Changes in confidence over time are exactly the sort of thing CLF models were designed to represent

- a time set
- a modeling language
- a set of extrasystematic constraints
